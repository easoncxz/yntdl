YNTDL
=========

YNTDL stands for "YNTDL is Not a ToDo List", although in fact - it sort of is. It is named this way because it's not (going to be) very complete/robust, since it's only a demo project.

This repo includes:

- a REST server that provides the YNTDL service over HTTP; and
- a simple custom HTTP client to consume the service.

Everything in here uses the Spring Framework. It's better to use STS ("Spring Tool Suite") to work with this repo. Assuming you'll use STS, if you're to create a new project into which to copy these source code, pick "Spring MVC" as your type of Spring project.
